# Kanagawa for VSCode

A Visual Studio Code theme inspired by the beautiful [Kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) Neovim theme. This theme is based on the original [kanagawa.vscode](https://github.com/barklan/kanagawa.vscode) repository but has been updated and adjusted to match the Neovim Kanagawa theme as closely as possible.

## Features

- Updated colors to closely match [Kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim).
- Adjusted semantic tokens for better syntax highlighting.
